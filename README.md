## Dev story

Hello,

From the off, it's quite evident I did not build this with R/Shiny. The simple answer is that I have no knowledge of the `R` programming language. I decided to go the javascript route and build a representation and visualization using the javascript `D3` library.

It's quite deficient and 70 hours since my first attempt learning the library, I still struggle with some concepts and finding a way to make it work with `React` (my area of expertise) was a daunting but a rather interesting challenge.

Thanks for the challenge and taking time out to look at it.
